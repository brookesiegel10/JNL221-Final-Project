<div class="story">
  <p>Last season, Caitlin Clark impressed the nation during March Madness not only with her talent, but with her attitude. After being the first player to ever score a 40-point triple-double, Clark stayed humble and <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/ncaa/2023/03/27/6421292022601d770c8b45ca.html">credited her team for her success</a>. This mix of athleticism and enthusiasm is something college basketball recruiters dream of, and are actively seeking when finding new players for their team. </p>

  <p>But how exactly do recruiters find these star-studded players? For Syracuse women’s basketball assistant coach and recruiting coordinator Kristen Sharkey, it starts with connections. </p>

  <p>“It's a big relationships game,” she said. </p>

  <p>Those relationships can help get the high level players they’re seeking. Relationships are especially useful with private schools such as IMG Academy and New Hope Academy, who are known to train their players for collegiate and professional level sports. </p>

  <p>“A lot of time those prep schools make kind of like super teams, so it's always good to have those relationships with those coaches in case you do want one of their players,” Sharkey said.</p>

<div class="story">
  <p>Players from these schools tend to commit to division I schools. For example, 2 players from IMG Academy currently attend Oregon. At the moment, Syracuse women’s basketball has two recruits for next year coming from DME Academy down in Florida. </p>

  <p>Once the connections with coaches are formed, the next step is to evaluate those top players. The decision to extend an offer is based on many factors, but perhaps the most important component is the height of potential recruits. In basketball, height can provide an extra jump shot or rebound which, at a high level of play, could be the difference between a win and a loss. </p>

  <p>“Size does matter and we do recruit size,” Sharkey said.</p>

  <p>And it’s not only a big thing for Syracuse. Teams across the nation are trying to recruit taller players in order to have a height advantage during matchups.</p>

  <p>“At this level when you go against like the North Carolina and the Dukes, they're all 6 feet and above,” Sharkey said. “So, [height] is a big thing for us.”</p>

  <p>Typically, taller players commit to Division I schools, as their programs are more competitive. This season, <a href="https://texassports.com/sports/womens-basketball/roster/abbie-boutilier/12622">Abbie Boutilier</a> at the University of Texas is the tallest player in the league, standing at six foot nine. While there are shorter players at Division I schools, there are more at programs in lower divisions.</p>

<div class="story">
  <p>However, this focus on height doesn’t rule out shorter players from making Division I teams, they just have to work a little harder for it. Sharkey says players with shorter stature can be valuable because they are usually faster than their taller counterparts. She also says that they can make themselves even more desirable if they play smart.</p>

  <p>“Usually if they're smaller, their basketball IQ has to be way higher than, like, the bigger athletic player because they have to be a little bit more savvy,” she said. </p>

<div class="story">
  <p>An example of a shorter player who is smart with their playing methods is Syracuse’s Dyaisha Fair. Recently, Fair has been named on three basketball award watchlists: the <a href="https://www.woodenaward.com/john_r_wooden_award_presented_by_principal_announces_2023_24_women_s_preseason_top_50_watch_list">Wooden Award</a>, <a href="https://www.hoophall.com/news/naismith-basketball-hall-of-fame-wbca-name-20-point-guards-to-2024-nancy-lieberman-award-watch-list/">Naismith Award</a>, and <a href="https://naismithtrophy.com/2023-24-jersey-mikes-naismith-womens-player-of-the-year-watchlist/">Nancy Lieberman Award</a>. Last year she earned All-ACC First Team and All-ACC Defensive Team honors. </p>

  <p>Along with relationships and height, recruiters also consider a player's attitude. Sharkey says negative attitudes or actions can be a reason for recruiters to pass on a player. </p>

  <p>“When we have our list of kids, we'll start checking kids off just based on, like, if you see them acting disrespectful to their mom after the game,” she said. “We'll be like, eh that might not be what we want.”</p>

  <p>Recruiters try to avoid players with negative attitudes because their attitude can affect the team’s chemistry. Since basketball is a team sport, the players have to have a level of trust between each other to know that they can follow through or assist on a play. Specifically in college basketball, the players are each other’s friends and tend to spend lots of time off the court together. Sharkey says if one of the players has a bad attitude or doesn’t get along with the other teammates, it could affect the team’s performance and atmosphere.</p>

  <p>“We definitely go after and try to figure out who they are because in the locker room… you got to win in there first before you can ever win on the court,” Sharkey said.</p>
